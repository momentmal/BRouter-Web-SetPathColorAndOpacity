## Description

This is a quick hack (Chrome Extension) I did (via AI assisted coding) for BRouter-Web to allow me to recolor the blue imported GPX tracks.
Note that currently the functionality is limited. The Extension modifies the DOM globally and recolors the path elements there.
At the moment, no seperate coloring of isolated tracks is possible by hiding / unhiding paths that should not be affected.

## Changelog
See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/momentmal/BRouter-Web-SetPathColorAndOpacity/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
