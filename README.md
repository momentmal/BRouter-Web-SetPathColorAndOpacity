This is a quick hack (Chrome Extension) I did (via AI assisted coding) for BRouter-Web to allow me to recolor the blue imported GPX tracks.
Note that currently the functionality is limited. The Extensions modifies the dom and recolors the path elements there. Elements that are hidden during recoloring don't remember its state, so you can only globally change the color to a custom color and maybe import a few blue default tracks after that.
At the moment, no seperate coloring of isolated tracks is possible.
